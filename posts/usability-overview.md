## Scientific Management

The process of increasing work efficiency through analysis
of workflow. 

Taylor, the creator of this process conducted a series of 
experiments with different shovel size, shape, and handle length.
Taylor   theorized that   these variables would influence 
how long it takes to move a unit of coal and how much  
effort  it  takes  for  the  workman   to  perform   
the  task.


## Time & Motion study

### Fittsâ€™ Law

The closer the control and the larger the control the easier it will be for the user to select it.

The equation is: 

** ID=Log2(1+D/W) ** 

ID is the index of difficulty or how hard it is to click a button.

D is distance the cursor must travel.

W is the size of button to be clicked. 

Note: the log is base 2.

### Ergonomics

The process of adapting the work environment to fit the needsof the human frame

Examples of ergonomics:

* How to avoid eyestrain in work by custom the monitor and place work.

* Qwerty Keyboard:  In  1932,  Dr.  August Dvorak performed a series of studies revealing that the QWERTY keyboard caused  us  to  perform  most  of  our  typing  with  our  weakest  hand  (56%), makes  most  use  of  our  weakest  finger,  and  most  of  the  common sequences of letters in the English language require us to jump over the home  row.

* The position of the computer screen with respect to the user's eyes 

# The Human Computer Interaction (HCI) process

** Analysis ** : The process of discovering the problems with a given design 
Activities performed during the analysis phase include learning about the target audience, understanding how the target audience uses the system to accomplish a task, and identifying what success for a given design looks like.


** Design ** : The process of channeling creative processes to maximize the chance a good design will be found
These  tools  include  a  structured,  iterative design process through which multiple design alternatives are evaluated. Following this, one or more prototypes are created  where the strengths and weaknesses of a design can be more readily identified. Finally,all the design details are carefully described in a functional specification.

** Verification ** : The process of validating all the assumptions made during the analysis and design process
This typically involves taking a design to real users and carefully observing how they interact with the system. The steps in the verification process include identifying the research questions that need to be answered in the usability study, creating experiments that enable   us   to   gather   data   for   these   questions,   combining all   the experiments into a single usability plan, performing the plan on members of the target audience, and carefully analyzing the results.
